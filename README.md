Practical work with landing page hosting on Wordpress
## The result of the first task
I've mastered Figma: creating an account, working with the interface. He developed a corporate identity: he created 3 variants of a scalable logo, selected a font system (text, header, accidental) and a color palette based on color harmony. I have created a ready-made project in Figma on TK.
## The result of the second task
Mastered adaptive web design at Figma. I created a "live" clickable prototype using the corporate identity and technical specifications. Implemented adaptability: configured 6 breakpoints (from XXL to X-Small) based on the Bootstrap 5 12-column grid. I used 2-3 conscious UX animations for interactivity. Filled it with content in compliance with typography.
## The result of the third task
Mastered adaptive layout in HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 5. Implemented semantic and cross-browser markup. Created an adaptive layout based on the Figma prototype and the Bootstrap grid. Organized the file structure of the project (images, styles, js). I've moved the entire visual style to an external CSS file. I applied the Class Naming methodology (BEM). Added interactive UX1 animations using CSS and JavaScript.
## The result of the fourth task
I have mastered the integration of design in WordPress. I created a custom theme based on a ready-made HTML/CSS layout. I have configured the functionality for editing page content through the WYSIWIG editor and menu management through the administrative panel. Organized the theme files (style.css, index.php , header.php , footer.php , functions.php ). I have published a working website on a free hosting with PHP and DATABASE support.
